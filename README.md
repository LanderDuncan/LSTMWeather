# LSTM Weather

This project examines the accuracy of a simple LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for predicting the weather in a singular location.

## Demo

You can find a demo of this project at <a href="https://weather.martinangell.com" target="_blank">weather.martinangell.com</a> or <a href="https://weather.landerduncan.net" target="_blank">weather.landerduncan.net</a> depending on which of us you like more

## Technologies

To construct this project we used the following technologies:

- Tensorflow
- Typescript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- ReactJS

## Structure

This project uses a relatively standard frontend/backend structure. We worked this in by having different folders for each. The backend loads the statically compiled files generated by our react build and incorporates it with the backend logic. Because of this organizational structure they could be easily worked on independently.

## Installation Guide

Begin by cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LanderDuncan/LSTMWeather.git
```

Then install the dependencies for and build the frontend

```bash
cd LSTMWeather/frontend
npm i
npm run build
```

Finally, install the dependencies for and launch the backend

```bash
cd ../
npm i
npm start
```
